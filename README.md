Intruder Alarm System â€“ A basic security circuit designed to detect unauthorized access.
This repo includes:
-Circuit schematic (.sch)
-PCB layout (.pcb)
-Gerber files for manufacturing
Based on a PIR motion sensor and buzzer trigger mechanism.
Designed in [EasyEDA/KiCad/etc.], optimized for a small PCB footprint.
Tested on breadboard before designing final PCB.
Built as part of my hands-on learning in electronics. Simple but functional a small step toward smarter hardware systems.
