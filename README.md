<strong>Intruder Alarm System</strong> â€“ A basic security circuit designed to detect unauthorized access.
<br>This repo includes:
<br>-Circuit schematic (.sch)
<br>-PCB layout (.pcb)
<br>-Gerber files for manufacturing
<br>Based on a PIR motion sensor and buzzer trigger mechanism.
<br>Designed in [EasyEDA/KiCad/etc.], optimized for a small PCB footprint.
<br>Tested on breadboard before designing final PCB.
<br>Built as part of my hands-on learning in electronics. Simple but functional a small step toward smarter hardware systems.
